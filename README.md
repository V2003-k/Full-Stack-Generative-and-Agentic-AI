# Full-Stack Generative and Agentic AI

I built this repository to demonstrate a complete generative AI models with agentic orchestration. This project is a hands-on end-to-end implementation: from model inference and prompt engineering to multi-agent coordination, APIs, frontend integration, and deployment automation. I completed the project and am sharing it here as a reference implementation and starting point for others.

## Highlights

- Full-stack architecture linking model inference, agents, and UI/API layers
- Agentic workflows: task decomposition, planning, execution, and monitoring
- Modular Python codebase with clear interfaces for models, tools, and agents
- Example pipelines for LLM-based generation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and tool use
- Docker and deployment-ready configuration

## Where to start

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

## Quickstart

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/V2003-k/Full-Stack-Generative-and-Agentic-AI.git
cd Full-Stack-Generative-and-Agentic-AI
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
